# Update Me

Staying up to date with the news and social media is important, but **dangerous**. It's easy to open up a news app or Twitter to check current happenings only to find yourself doom scrolling for the next 30 minutes.

## Goal

Set up a system of semi-regularly (ie weekly/bi-weekly) pushing me **relevant** information to avoid having to navigate to apps that support endless scrolling.

Also planning to use Terraform and AWS to construct and host this system.
